CS106B-ASSIGNMENTS
==================
The description of the content of CS106B Programming Abstraction as mentioned
in lecture 1 of the winter quarter 2013 


-----------------------------------------------
*The Big Ideas in CS 106B


- *Recursion*.
  Recursion is an enormously powerful technique that enables you to solve
  complex problems that you would never be able to solve without it. 

- *Data abstraction*.
  For most of the quarter, weâ€™ll be learning about a variety of abstract 
  data types that will prove to be enormously valuable as you write programs.

- *Algorithmic efficiency*.
  As you will learn over the course of the quarter, different algorithms 
  can vary enormously in terms of the amount of time required to solve a
  particular problem.  In CS 106B, you will learn how to measure algorithmic
  efficiency along with some general techniques for developing efficient
  algorithms.
